# Arduino to Chataigne Bridge
Simple tool to take in arduino over serial and forward its data via osc to chataigne

Reason was because at the time of writing this I was not using chataigne, but rolling my own osc bridge. So this tied right in.

There is reference to other tools in this. If interested let me know

# Reason for development
This was developed for my twitch bot to take in sound and a few other key features, pass that into a machine learning system, and to gather insights,
such as if characters should be dancing on screen or not, or when to trigger game elements.

Nowadays I use a different system, however this is good for history and for pointing to others how they can start to bridge the hardware software gap,
even more so for the twitch community.
